<a target="_blank" href="https://loda-lang.org/">LODA</a> is an assembly language,
a computational model, and a distributed tool for mining programs.
You can use it to generate and search programs that compute integer sequences from the
<a target="_blank" href="https://oeis.org/">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences®</a> (OEIS®).
The goal of the project is to find new formulas and
more efficient algorithms for a wide range of non-trivial integer sequences.

The chart shows of the number of programs since the start of the project.
You can see live stats of the program mining on our

Live updates on new findings are published by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/lodaminer">@lodaminer</a> on Twitter.
